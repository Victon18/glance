```python

import requests
import json
import sqlite3  # Example database for storage

# Constants
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your actual API key
CITY = 'London'
URL = f'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={CITY}&appid={API_KEY}'

# Make the API request
response = requests.get(URL)

# Check for a successful response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    data = None

# Print the data for verification
if data:
    print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('weather_data.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Create table if it doesn't exist
c.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS weather (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        city TEXT,
        temperature REAL,
        description TEXT,
        timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    )
''')

# Insert data into the database
if data:
    temperature = data['main']['temp']
    description = data['weather'][0]['description']
    c.execute('''
        INSERT INTO weather (city, temperature, description)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?)
    ''', (CITY, temperature, description))
    conn.commit()

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

7. Data Modeling Concepts
- What is the importance of normalization and denormalization in data modeling?
Provide an example of when denormalization would be preferred in a data engineering context.

---
Normalization is the process of organizing data within a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
The primary goals are:
    1. Elimination of Redundancy: By dividing large tables into smaller, related ones, normalization minimizes duplicate data.
    2. Data Integrity: Ensures that data dependencies are logical and that data modifications (insertions, updates, deletions) do not lead to anomalies.
    3. Ease of Maintenance: Simplifies updates and schema changes, as data is stored in a structured manner.
Normal Forms: Normalization typically involves several stages, known as normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.), each with specific rules for organizing data.

Denormalization is the process of combining tables that were previously normalized to improve read performance.
Key reasons for denormalization include:
    1. Performance Optimization: In read-heavy applications, denormalization can speed up query performance by reducing the number of joins needed.
    2. Simplified Queries: Denormalized structures can make querying simpler and more intuitive, especially for reporting and analytics.
    3. Real-Time Data Access: In warehousing or OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems, quick access to data can take precedence over data integrity concerns.

Example of Denormalization in Data Engineering

Scenario: A data warehouse for an e-commerce platform.

In a normalized database schema, you might have several tables:
    - Customers: Contains customer details (CustomerID, Name, Email, etc.)
    - Orders: Contains order details (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount, etc.)
    - Products: Contains product details (ProductID, ProductName, Price, etc.)
    - OrderItems: Contains details about the products in each order (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, etc.)

In this normalized structure, querying for the total sales per customer involves joining multiple tables, which can be performance-intensive.
To optimize read performance for reporting, you might create a denormalized table, such as:
- CustomerSales:
    - CustomerID
    - Name
    - Email
    -  TotalSales
    - LastPurchaseDate
    - ProductList (a list of products bought by the customer)

In this denormalized table, all relevant information for a report on customer sales is consolidated into a single table.
This structure allows for faster query performance since it eliminates the need for multiple joins and can facilitate quicker aggregations.
