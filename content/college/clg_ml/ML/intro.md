# supervised learning
- the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data comes with corresponding output labels.
- The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
- Examples:
    - Classification: Predicting a discrete label. (e.g., spam detection, image recognition)
    - Regression: Predicting a continuous value. (e.g., predicting house prices, stock market trends)

# Unsupervised Machine Learning
- a branch of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on data that does not have labeled responses.
- the machine is given a bunch of data and is asked to find patterns, structures, or relationships in that data without being told what to look for.
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points together.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying the data while keeping its essential features.

# Reinforcement Machine Learning
- In this an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
- reinforcement learning focuses on learning from the consequences of actions, typically through trial and error

Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning
---
- AGENT: the learner or decision maker that interacts with the environment
- ENVIRONMENT:everything the agent interacts with.
    it provides feedback in form of rewards or penalities based on the actions taken by the agent
- STATE (S): a representation of current situation or configuration of the environment
- ACTION (A): any move that an agent can make in the environment
- REWARD (R): feedback from environment based on action taken by the agent. It can be positive or negative

# Deep learning

- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks,
- It simulates the complex decisionmaking power of the human brain.
