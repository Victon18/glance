# code
1. This indicates the beginning of the setup() function, which is a special function in Arduino programming that is executed only once when the board is powered on or reset.
```
void setup() {
```
2. Initializes LED_BUILTIN is a predefined constant in Arduino that refers to the built-in LED pin on the board.
pinMode() is a function that sets the mode of a pin as either input or output
```
 pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
```
3. Serial is a predefined object in Arduino that provides serial communication functions.
begin() is a function that initializes the serial communication with a specified baud rate.
In this case, we are setting the baud rate to 9600, which is a standard baud rate used for serial communication.
```
Serial.begin(9600);
   }
```
4. loop function start
```
void loop() {
```
5. Serial.available() is a function that returns the number of bytes available to read in the incoming serial buffer.
If there are bytes available, the if statement evaluates to true and the code inside the block is executed.
```

if (Serial.available()){
  char data;
```
6. Serial.read() is a function that reads the first byte of available data from the incoming serial buffer and returns it as a character.
```
  data=Serial.read();
```
7. Serial.println() is a function that prints the specified data followed by a newline character to the serial monitor.
```
  Serial.println(data);
```
8. The code then checks the value of data using an if-else statement. If data is 'o', the built-in LED is turned on for 2 seconds:
```
  if (data =='o'){
```
9. digitalWrite() is a function that sets the specified pin to either HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V) level.
In this case, we are setting the LED pin to HIGH level, which turns the LED on.
delay() is a function that pauses the execution of the program for a specified number of milliseconds.
```
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN,HIGH);
    delay(2000);
  }
```
10. If data is not 'o', the code checks if it is 'c'. If it is, the built-in LED is turned off for 2 seconds:
```
  else if(data =='c'){
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN  ,LOW);
```
11.digitalWrite() is used again to set the LED pin to LOW level, which turns the LED off.

```
    delay(2000);
  }
}

}
```
