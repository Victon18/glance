# Extra net
Network within an organization, using internet to connect to outside in controlled manner
Exrtanet is implimented as VPN (Virtual Private Network) because it uses internet to connect to corporate organization and there is always a threat to information security.
VPN offers a secure network in public infrastructure (Internet).
VPN uses Internet Protocol Security Architecture (IPSEC) Protocol to provide secure transactions by adding an additional security layer to TCP/IP protocol.
This layer is created by encapsulating the IP packet to a new IP packet

implimentation
----
1. The packet is encapsulated at boundary of networks in IPSEC complaint routers.
2. It uses an encryption key to encapsulate packets and IP addresses as well.
3. The packet is decoded only by the IPSEC complaint routers or servers.
4. The message is sent over VPN via VPN Tunnel and this process is known as tunneling.

issues
---

- HOSTING
----
Where the extranet pages will be held i.e. who will host the extranet pages.
In this context there are two choices:
1. Host it on your own server.
2. Host it with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the same way as web pages.
But hosting extranet pages on your own server requires high bandwidth internet connection which is very costly

- SECURITY
----
Additional firewall security is required if you host extranet pages on your own server which result in a complex security mechanism and increase work load.

- ACCESSING ISSUES
---
Information can not be accessed without internet connection. However, information can be accessed in Intranet without internet connection.

- DECREASED INTERACTION
---
It decreases the face to face interaction in the business which results in lack of communication among customers, business partners and suppliers.
