How It Works:
    1. Look for Clues:
        As you read, you pay attention to details and hints the author gives about the characters and events.
    2. Make Predictions:
        You think about what could happen next.
    3. Use Your Imagination:
        You use your own experiences and ideas to fill in the gaps of the story.
Making Predictions
    - Predicting future developments based on the text.
    - Extending the text's ideas to potential scenarios or applications.

Problem-Solving and Innovation
    - Applying the text's principles to solve real-world problems.
    - Innovating new approaches or solutions inspired by the text.
# Writing
## Inductive style
Specific examples first, then a big idea.
You start with examples and then come up with a big idea from those examples.
If the main summarising idea of the whole paragraph is found in the last sentence.
If the paragraph begins with the example and builds up illustrative support for the main point

This is an inductive style of writing.

## Deductive style
Big idea first, then a specific example.
You start with a big idea (all crayons are colors) and then give a specific example to show it’s true.
If we move that final sentence to the beginning of the paragraph, then we have a deductive style of writing
