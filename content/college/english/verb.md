# Types of Verbs
## Main/ Principal verb:
- The main or the principal verb refers to the action or a state of being of the subject in a sentence.
- It can stand alone, or it can be used with an auxiliary verb.
- Main verbs can be classified into two primary forms:
### Action verbs
- It is a verb that describes an action
- Amit (subject) is (aux) singing (action verb) a(det) song (noun).
### Linking verbs
- It is a verb that links the subject of the sentence to another word that describes that subject.
- ‘to be’ and its forms- (i.e. is, am, are, was, were, being, been, etc.),
- ‘to become’-(i.e. become, became, has become, have become, will become, etc.),
- ‘to seem’-(i.e. seemed, seems, has seemed, etc.)
- appear, feel, grow, look, remain, smell, sound, stay, taste, turn
- Note :- linking verbs and action verbs.
    - Sumit always smells like coconut oil. the linking verb (smells) describes Sumit (the subject),
    - Sumit always smells coconut oil. it does not qualify as a linking verb as it becomes an action verb here
## Aux
- The auxiliary verb assists the main verb to establish a complete thought
### Primary Auxiliaries
- ‘Be’, ‘Have’, and ‘Do’ (and their forms) are used both as a main verb as well as auxiliaries.
- These are auxiliaries only when they help other verbs to form their tenses
- 'Be’ as the main verb vs ‘Be’ as an auxiliary
    - Sam is a footballer.
    - Suresh is writing a letter.
- ‘Do’ as a main verb vs ‘Do’ as an auxiliary
    - We have done the shopping.
    - Do you know where my boss lives?
- ‘Have’ as the main verb vs ‘Have’ as an auxiliary
    - I have a car.
    - I have not completed my work yet.
### Modal auxiliaries
- shall, should; will, would; can, could; may; might; must; ought to; need; dare.
- These verbs are used to express the
    - abilities (e.g. capacity, potential, power, talent, etc.),
    - possibilities (e.g. chance, likelihood, probability, prospect etc.),
    - permissions (e.g. consent, authority, licence, etc.),
    - obligations (e.g. duty, commitment, responsibility, task, etc.)
- These modal auxiliaries have three common characteristics:
    - These are always used with the main verb, which is either present or implied. He should learn horse riding.
    - These have a single/identical form under the Present tense with 1st, 2nd and 3rd person, I can write; You can write
    - Primary auxiliaries have different forms with all three persons, e.g. I am writing; You are writing, and He is writing.
    - These do not carry the infinitive or participle forms
# Depending on whether the verb takes an object
## Transitive Verbs
- It is a type of verb that denotes an action which passes over from the doer or agent to an object. e.g.
    - I admire your courage.
    - She loves animals.
- The verbs like-address, borrow, bring, discuss, raise, offer and pay functions as a transitive verb.
- There are some verbs which occur with two objects. These are known as Ditransitive verbs.
    - We (subject) gave (verb) Ravi (indirect object] a book (direct object).
    - We (subject) bought (verb) Amit (indirect object) a birthday cake (direct object).
- when the verbs which take only a direct object are called Mono transitive verbs.
    - Sumit (subject) told (verb) a story (direct object).
    - She (subject) read (verb) the speech (direct object).
## Intransitive Verbs
- It is a type of verb that denotes an action which does not pass over to the object.
    - The stars twinkle brightly.
    - The guests arrived at the hotel in New Delhi.
- The verbs like- come, go, fall, die, sleep, lie, awake, walk, rise, swim and crawl functions as intransitive verb.
- Note: When an intransitive verb is used in a causative sense, it becomes transitive.
    - He sat on a mat (sat-intransitive)
    - He (subject) sat me (object) on a mat

# Tensed/finite Verbs
- if a verb does not talk about the tense, what does it tell us about?
    - Aspect [Progressive (-ing) or Perfect(-en/-ed)] and
    - Mood [Subjunctive, Imperative and Infinitive]
- Verbs which inflect for tense are known as finite verbs.
- a finite verb agrees with the person or number with its subject.
# Non-finite
- verbs which cannot make tense on their own or requires a main/helping verb
- They're called non-finite as they're not limited to a specific subject or time frame.
- Non-finite verbs do not inflect for tense.
- A non-finite verb need not agree with the person and number of its subject.
- The three non-finite forms of the verb are: 1. Infinitive, 2. Gerund, and 3. Participle.
## Infinitives
- Infinitives are non-finite verbs that are often preceded by ‘to’.
- There are four kinds of infinitive:
### To-infinitive
- (to + first form of the verb)
- A ‘to’ infinitive can function as a subject, direct object, subject complement, adjective or as an adverb in a sentence.
1. To find fault in others is easy(subject).
2. Everyone wanted to swim. (direct object)
3. Her desire is to sing. (subject complement)
4. This is a site to see. (adjective)
5. They must sing to learn. (adverb)
Note:
➢ If a verb related to a skill is in the infinitive
form, we use ‘how’ before the infinitive.
I am learning how to ride a bicycle/horse.
➢ Do not confuse an infinitive (i.e. to +
verb) with a prepositional phrase [i.e. to +
noun/pronoun].
Infinitives: e.g. to walk, to read, to sing, to
catch, etc.
- Prepositional phrases: e.g. to him, to the committee, to my house, etc.
### Split Infinitive
- A split infinitive is understood when a full infinitive (to+ verb) is split into two parts, and an adverb is placed between the two.
- He asked me to clearly write my bio-data.
### Anaphoric ‘to’
- Sometimes ‘to’ alone is used instead of ‘to+ first form of the verb’ (i.e. full infinitive).
- It is understood as anaphoric usage because it refers back to something in the text.
- Rohan: Would you like to have samosa? Sohan: Yes, I would love to. (here ‘to’ refers back to ‘to have samosa’)
### Bare Infinitive:
- An infinitive without ‘to’ is known as a bare infinitive.
- A bare infinitive has a deceptive form because it looks like a finite verb, which is not the case.
- I saw him cross the road.
- He made me sing.
## Gerund:
- The first form of the verb +‘ing’, which is used as a noun in a sentence
- It can function in various ways:
    - As an object e.g. He likes driving.
    - As a subject e.g. Smoking is prohibited in a public place.
    - As an appositive e.g. My favourite summer activity, swimming, keeps me always active.
## Participles
- Participles are used as adjectives and most often end with -ing or -ed.
- They modify nouns and pronouns.
- There are three types of participles:
### Present Participle
- (base form of verb +ing),
- The sleeping child was wearing a wet diaper.
- He tried to console the crying baby.
### Past Participle
- (third form of the verb)
- The wounded soldier was crawling in the forest.
- He was wearing a torn shirt.
### Perfect Participle (V3)
- (having+third form of the verb)
- Having finished his work, Mukesh was ready to play.
- The child, having found its mother, was again happy.
