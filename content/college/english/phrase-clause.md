Think of phrases and clauses like building blocks in a sentence.

---
Phrases are like little groups of words that go together, but they don’t have a subject doing a verb.

For example, "in the park" is a phrase.
It tells you where something is, but it doesn’t tell you who is doing what.

---

---
Clauses are like bigger blocks.
They have a subject (who or what) and a verb (what they’re doing).
Number of finite verbs in a sentence is equal to the number of clauses in that sentence.
For example, "The dog barks" is a clause because it tells you who is doing something and what they are doing.

Modifiers
---
Think of modifiers like special stickers you put on your words to make them more interesting or clear.
Modifiers are words or phrases that tell us more about something. They help us understand more details.
Types of Modifiers:
    - Adjectives: These are words that describe nouns (people, places, things).
        For example, in "the big dog," "big" is a modifier that tells us what kind of dog it is.
    - Adverbs: These are words that describe verbs (actions).
        For example, in "runs quickly," "quickly" tells us how the running is done.
Types on basis of position
    - Premodifier (a modifier which comes before noun head)
    - Postmodifier (a modifier which comes after noun head)
Modifiers can be at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence. For example:
    - "The happy cat sleeps." (The adjective "happy" modifies "cat.")
    - "She sings beautifully." (The adverb "beautifully" modifies "sings.")

## clauses
There are five elements of a clause: Subject (S), Predicator (P), Object (O), Complement (C) and Adverbial (A).
Subject and Predicator is the minimum requirement for giving a group of words the form of a clause.

#### Independent Clauses
- These are like strong, independent superheroes! They can stand alone and still make sense.
- Example: "I like ice cream."
- How to spot one: If you can say it by itself and it sounds complete, it’s independent!

#### Dependent Clauses
- These are like sidekicks that need help!
- They can’t stand alone because they don’t make complete sense by themselves.
- Example: "because I like ice cream."
- How to spot one: If it starts with a word like "because," "when," or "if," and doesn’t sound complete alone, it’s dependent!
##### Adjective Clauses
- These describe nouns, like how superheroes wear capes!
- Example: "The dog that barks is loud."
- How to spot one: Look for words like "that," "who," or "which." They help tell us more about the noun.

##### Adverb Clauses
- These tell us more about the action, like where, when, or why something happens, like sidekicks helping out!
- Example: "I eat ice cream when it’s hot."
- How to spot one: Look for words like "when," "because," "if," or "although." They explain more about the verb.
##### Noun Clauses
- These act like a noun in a sentence, like a special team player!
- Example: "What you said made me happy."
- How to spot one: Look for words like "what," "that," or "how." They can replace a noun in the sentence.


#### Relative clause
---
Think of a relative clause (RC) enabler like a little bridge that connects two parts of a sentence.
It helps you add more information about something!
Example
If you say, "The dog is cute," that's nice.
But if you want to say more about the dog, you can use an RC enabler.

You could say, "The dog that has a blue collar is cute."

Here, "that" is the RC enabler.
It helps you connect the extra information (the blue collar) to the dog.
So now, you know which dog is cute! It helps make sentences even better by adding details.
