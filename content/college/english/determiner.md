# determiners
- A class of pre-noun modifiers
-  Many nouns (single countable nouns, plural countable nouns and uncountable nouns) are usually preceded by a determiner,
- determiners signal nouns.
- A determiner, unlike an adjective that specifies the quality of a noun, is a word or group of words placed before a noun or noun phrase to indicate its reference.
- This includes indicating whether the noun is definite or indefinite, its ownership, quantity and other such aspects (excluding quality).
- Depending on their relative position before a noun, determiners can be classified into three types:
    1. pre- determiners,
    2. central determiners
    3. post-determiners.

difference

|Pre|central|Post|
|-|-|-|
|These come before central determiners and provide extra information about quantity or emphasis.|These come right before the noun and identify or specify it|These come after central determiners and give additional information about quantity or order.|
|**All** the children|**The** cat|The **two** apples|
|**All** my two favorite books are on the shelf.|All **my** two favorite books are on the shelf.|All my **two** favorite books are on the shelf.|

## predeterminer
A predeterminer helps you add a little more detail before you say what you mean.
- Used to express a proportion of the whole-- all, both, half
- Multipliers double, twice, thrice, five times, etc.
- Fractions one-third, one-tenth, etc.
- Such, what

how to spot
- Look for Words Like:
    "all," "both," "half," "several," and "many."
    These words come before other determiners (like "the" or "my").

- Check the Noun: If it helps to describe how much or how many of something there is, it’s probably a predeterminer.

## central determiner
Central determiners are words that help you know more about a noun, like a toy or a snack.
They usually come right before a noun and tell us which one or how many.
Some common central determiners are:
    - Articles: "a," "an," and "the" (Definite and Indefinite)
    - Demonstratives: "this," "that," "these," and "those"
    - Possessives: "my," "your," "his," "her," "our," and "their" (like "my toy" or "her cookie")
    - Quantifiers:  some, any, every, each, either, neither, no, enough, much

To identify a central determiner, look for a word right before a noun that tells you which one it is or who it belongs to.
For example, in "my favorite book," "my" is the central determiner that tells you who the book belongs to.

## post determiner

Post determiners are words that come after a central determiner and give a bit more detail about a noun.
They help tell us more about how many or which kind of something we are talking about.

Some examples of post determiners are:
    - Numbers/Cardinals: like "two," "three," or "ten"
    - Quantifiers: like "many," "few," or "several", "most", "many", "(a) little", "(a) few", "less", etc.
    - Ordinal numbers: like "first," "second," or "last"
To identify a post determiner, look for a word right after a central determiner that adds extra information about the noun.
For example, in "the three dogs," "three" is the post determiner that tells us how many dogs there are

## some important ones

1. Some and Any
---
- Some is used in positive statements to denote “no particular” and it can also be used in interrogatives for offers and requests.
- While ‘any’ is used in negative and interrogative sentences.

---
2. Much and Many
---
- Much is used with singular uncountable nouns and many with plural nouns.

---
3. Each and Every
---
Every and each are used with singular nouns to mean all.

---
4. Both, Either and Neither
---
Both, either, neither are used to talk about two people or things.
Nouns with ‘both’ take plural verb but nouns with either and neither take a singular verb.
Neither is used to make a negative statement.

---
- Quantifiers used with both countable and uncountable nouns:
---
all, no, some, any, more, most, a lot, enough, less

---
- Quantifiers used only with countable nouns:

---
(not) many, several, each, both, either, neither, (a) few, fewer

---
- Use of articles with quantifiers
---
- 'a little' or 'little' is used with an uncountable noun.
- 'a few' or 'few' is used with a plural countable noun.
- Both have slightly different meanings 'a little' or 'a few', means a small amount, but it's enough:
- On the other hand, 'little' or 'few' also mean negligible amount
- 'a lot' means the same as 'lots'. A lot of and lots of can both be used with plural countable nouns and with singular uncountable nouns
- Several determiners including fractions (one-third) and quantifiers like a lot, etc. have the alternative of-construction.
