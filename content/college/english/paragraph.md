1. Logical bridges (Coherence)
    - The same idea of a topic is carried over from sentence to sentence
    - Successive sentences can be constructed in parallel form
2. Verbal bridges (Cohesion)
    - Repeat key words
    - Use synonyms
    - Use Pronouns
    - Use transition words to link ideas from different sentences

Coherence and Cohesion are traits which make a paragraph easily comprehensible.
# Unify Paragraphs
- Develop a single idea.
- Use topic sentences that state the main idea of the paragraph.
- Other sentences should support the idea expressed in the topic sentence.
- For support, use examples, data, or logical progression.
# Writing Coherent Paragraphs
- Organize paragraphs appropriately.
- Use transitional words and phrases between paragraphs and sentences, if necessary.
