# IPA
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
Phoneme:- A phoneme is a speech sound. It is the smallest unit of sound that distinguishes one word from another.

Alphabet -> 26; vowels -> 5; consonants -> 21
sounds -> 44; vowels -> 20; consonants -> 24
vowels have two types of sounds
- Monothongs -> 12
- dipthongs -> 8
# Vowels

When vowel sounds are articulated, the air from the lungs passes:
- freely
-   continuously
-  through the mouth (oral cavity)
The vowel sounds can also be elongated easily.
There is no obstruction by the speech organs such as teeth, tongue, palate, etc.
