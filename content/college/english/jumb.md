# Jumbled Paragraph
Para jumbles refer to jumbled paragraphs where the sentences, phrases, or words are incorrect.
The task is to rearrange them logically to form a coherent paragraph.

Below are some methods or strategies to solve para jumbles with high accuracy:
1. Identify the Opening Sentence:
---
The first sentence typically introduces a topic, and it is often independent of any other sentence.
It may define, explain, or present the main subject of the paragraph.
Technique:
    - Look for sentences that introduce an idea or concept.
    -Avoid beginning sentences with pronouns such as
        "he," "she," or "they," as well as transitional phrases like "however" or "but,"
        since these are typically used after an introductory statement.

---
2.  Find the Closing Sentence
---
The closing sentence typically summarizes the main idea or provides a conclusion to the paragraph.
Technique:
    - Look for a sentence that wraps up the discussion.
    - It may restate the main point or provide a final thought, conclusion, or result.

---
3.  Identify Transition Words like "however," "therefore," "but," and "because"
---
these indicate logical flow between sentences.
These sentences cannot be the first and usually link ideas from the previous sentences.

Technique:
- Look for transition words or conjunctions to link sentences logically.
- These words often provide hints about the flow of thought, especially when opposing ideas or conclusions are involved.

---
4.  Look for Pronouns and Nouns
---
Sentences containing pronouns like "he," "she," "they,  usually refer back to a noun introduced in a previous sentence.
These pronouns can't appear in the first sentence because they need an antecedent.

Technique:
    - Identify which sentences introduce proper nouns, names, or subjects.
    - Sentences with pronouns usually follow sentences where the person or object is first introduced.

---
5. Look for Cause and Effect
---
Some sentences naturally lead to others due to cause-and-effect relationships.
Phrases like "as a result," "therefore," and "because" often indicate such relationships.

Technique:
    - Identify cause-effect connectors that signal a dependency between sentences.
    - Arrange the sentences so that the cause comes before the effect.

---
6. Chronological Order
---
Some paragraphs describe events in a sequence of time.
When solving such para-jumbles, identifying time markers (dates, months, before, after) helps in determining the right order.
Technique:
    - Look for chronological indicators like specific years, "later," "earlier," or "next."
    - Arrange the sentences in the order of time progression.

---
7. Look for Logical Pairing (Block Building)
---
Certain sentences naturally belong together, either because they continue a line of thought or refer to the same idea.
Identifying these pairs can help you narrow down the correct order.
Technique:
    - Look for sentences that seem to follow directly after one another.
    - Group them into smaller chunks and arrange them within those blocks.

---
8.  Elimination Method
---
If you're unsure of the entire sequence, try eliminating sentences that clearly do not fit at the beginning or end.
This narrows down the choices.
Technique:
    - Eliminate any sentence that can't logically be the first or last.
    - Focus on sentences that clearly belong somewhere in the middle.
